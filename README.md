Software to perform variable temperature electrochemical impedance spectroscopy with temperature controlled stages and impedance analysers.

Please see "README.pdf" for more information.

**2023 Update**: This work has been further built upon by another FUSE intern, Arun Atwal. The new repository is available [here](https://github.com/Arun-Atwal/Electrochemical-Impedance-Spectroscopy-Automation).
