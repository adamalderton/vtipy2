# This is a script to stop the heating functionality of a connected Linkam stage, and then continue to plot the current temperature.
# This should be used in the event of a failure in vtipy2 perhaps, or any other emergency that would require the stage to begin cooling.
# This can also be used to simply check and monitor the temperature of a connected stage. Ensure not to run this if you do not want the stage to stop heating.
# Remember: vtipy2 also displays the current temperature, and has a stop button to stop the heating of a connected stage.
